# Power-BI-Dashboard-Project
This Power BI Project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data, offering valuable insights into sales performance, profit distribution, and customer behaviour across different categories, sub-categories, and payment methods.

# Key Insights and Features:
•	Total Sales & Key Metrics: An overview of key figures, such as total amount, profit, and quantity sold.
•	Profit by Month & Sub-category: Visualizations showing profit trends over time and profitability by specific product sub-categories.
•	Geographic Analysis: State-wise quantity analysis to identify top-performing regions.
•	Category Breakdown: A donut chart displaying the sales share of each category.
•	Payment Mode Analysis: A breakdown of quantities by different payment methods to understand customer preferences.
•	Order Trend Analysis: Monthly trend analysis of order volume.
•	Sales by category and Sub-Category: Detailed tree map analysis of category and sub-category sales, highlighting top sellers.

# Why This Project Stands Out
•	Visually Engaging: The dashboard features a combination of diverse visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, donut charts, and tree maps, creating an interactive and insightful analysis.
•	Business-Driven Insights: Each visual is designed to answer specific business questions, such as identifying high-profit categories and understanding customer purchasing trends.
•	Strategic Value: The insights derived from this dashboard can guide business strategies in sales optimization, regional targeting, and inventory planning.
